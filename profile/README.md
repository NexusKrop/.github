## Organisation Withdrawal from GitHub

All projects in this organisation are subject to general withdrawal, due to current community status and
GitHub platform crisis orginated from recent product changes.

General withdrawel will begin from 4 Feb 2023.

### What happened?

GitHub Copilot is not clear about GNU General Public License and copyleft-in-general compliance. To avoid
creating risk with its users, this project is moving to [a new home](https://codeberg.org/NexusKrop) where
projects will be hosted.

### Will you came back?

Not sure.

### What about WithLithum?

Any software developed on his own behalf will only be uploaded if it is related to Grand Theft Auto V modding, unless
anything changes in result of actions by GitHub.
