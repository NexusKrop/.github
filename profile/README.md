## Hi there 👋

This is **NexusKrop**, an organisation for all the stuff that is modding related. Non-modding related (generic) projects are carried over to more-OSS oriented platforms.

### Contributing to the project

Varies. Follow the guidelines if there is one in the repo you wanna contribute to; if not, it's probably wise to follow the Covenant.
