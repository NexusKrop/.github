# Minecraft-specific Code Training

We are aware of some minecraft-specific (especially server-side) dedicated code training or code classes. This document lists some requirements for contributors who have received Minecraft-specific training.

If you studied code yourselves for Minecraft and have been doing code on GitHub or other code hosting providers/VCS management software for over a month, as long as your code styles match our standards, then you are good to go, but you can still refer to this document.

## Basic Requirements

In addition to your Minecraft specific training, you must also be able to participate in general Java programming, Free (Libre) and Open Source development contributions, the usage of version control systems, GitHub usage, and Gradle usage before contributing to our repositories.

You must not use any external libraries other than those provided by the project. Only the maintainer of a project can decide whether to add any external dependencies to a project. Plus, you must be aware that your code is not private and will be available to the whole Internet.

Your teacher and any other staff from where you are trained for Minecraft specific coding may not interfere with your contribution in any way, and you must either prove that the legal entity who trained you will not interfere with your contribution (especially on copyright), or you must present a valid Copyright Disclaimer document signed by a member of such entity who has the authority to sign legal documents on behalf of such entity.
