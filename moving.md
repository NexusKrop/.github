# NexusKrop Moving (as for now)

NexusKrop is currently moving to [a new home](https://codeberg.org/NexusKrop) due to recent community situtation and risk factors involving GitHub, Inc. products and potentioal copyright risks.

## What is happening?

Free Software and Open Source community, specficially those supports Copyleft ideology, is in [serious and critical disputes](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) between
GitHub, Inc. regarding GitHub Copilot AI-assisted programming software/service, mainly on how GitHub, Inc. [uses public code in public projects](https://github.blog/2021-06-30-github-copilot-research-recitation/)
hosted on GitHub to train the AI model, which Open Source NGOs and lawyers believes to have infrigated copyright of the authors. Together with a general hatred towards Microsoft Corporation,
This issue triggered further disputes, resulting in NGOs calling open source project maintainers to move their project away from GitHub.

NexusKrop wants to see a resolution as soon as possible, but the copyright of public projects are matters between GitHub, Inc. and the FOSS community and NGOs.

## What if I have public projects hosted on GitHub?

This dispute currently does not impact the services and operation of GitHub, Inc. as of now but we advice to reconsider hosting if any of your project uses a licence
that is stricter than the MIT/Expat licence, even only slightly, until the disputes are resolved.

As for now, please refrain from using templates provided by NGOs.
