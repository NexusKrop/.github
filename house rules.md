# House Rules

These are rules within all of our repositories.

## Definitions

- ***Social Statuses*** includes but are not limited to race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

## Rules

- **We want to welcome anyone of any background and identity to be able to participate in the project.** It is strictly prohibited to have discriminations against anybody based on any Social Statuses, or intentionally creating conflict between anyone, based on their Social Statuses.
- **Do not import or create dramas.** If there is a drama on external communities you must avoid talking about it unless its absolutely necessary, and even if in this case, you should do what you can as possible to prevent the drama from being imported to our spaces.
  
  If a drama happens or was imported to our community spaces, we will have to suppress it by all means to protect our community. This could mean landing (sometimes quite severe) punishment strikes on who created it, imported it, and participated it. Remember that.
- **Keep it safe for work.** Posting anything NSFW will result in immediate punishment strike.
- **No continued or repeated harassment.** Generally, if someone asked you to stop saying something, you'd better stop.
- **No spamming or commercial advertising.** This generally will be landed with a definite ban or warning for the first instance.
- **No sexual harassment.**
- **No inappropriate language.** This includes racist language, or repeated obscene words.
- **No doxxing.** This means posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information.
- **Do not spam the emails of maintainers and anyone listed in the list below**.

## Recommendations

- Don't be a d*ck!
- Try to use a formal or a generally and universally friendly tone.
- People could be from anywhere in the world so you are advised to use English where possible.

## Enforcement

Report violations to project maintainers first. If you can't reach project maintainers, contact any of the following people:

- [WithLithum](https://github.com/WithLithum). Email is available in the user page. Please state `[NX VIOLATION REPORT]` in your title. You can also mention the user.

Reports will be dealt with fairly in accordance with this document, and they should usually be processed within a week or so. Project maintainers should also regularly check the Issues and Pull Requests section.

If violations are confirmed, actions will be taken accordingly based on the severity of the violation and the consequences it have brought or could have brought.

## Actions and Punishment Strikes

- **Advisory**: Sometimes also called Correction. Violators will be contacted privately and individually, telling them how they break the rules and why the rules is important. For smallest violations that doesn't result in severe consequences.
- **Warning**: A written (sometimes immediate) warning, usually at the channel where the violation happened.
- **Definite Ban**: Ban from interacting with this community for a definite amount of time.
- **Indefinite Ban**: Ban from interacting with this community indefinitely. Use with caution, only for either biggest violations that results in or could have resulted in fatal or very destructive or otherwise very very severe consequences, or for continued nonstop violation.
